The way this works is as follows: 
You will see parts contained between lines made of these symbols : >>>>>>(beggining), <<<<<<<<(closing)
Before each segment it writes which branches code is present in that segment.
You will then need to delete one of the presented segments. 
If you get stuck or if you can't decide what to delete be sure to contact the others in the group!
Thanks, Much love

Adam :)
